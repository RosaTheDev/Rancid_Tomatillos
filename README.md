### Reflection 

 
  ### Richard's Reflection 
- This is Jacob and mine's first time working with react and it was a really great project to start off on, I was surprisingly chill throughout all of it. It seems like most of the work I used to spend a ton of time on, React takes that workload off. What was most challenging for me was really figuring out Cypress I spent days combing through the testing lesson to get some type of a grasp on it, but I eventually figured it out by trial and error. 

- Jacob has been an amazing project partner. He really killed it with the UI and the design of this site, I really enjoyed working on paired programming with him, and even when we decided to split up and tackle some of the work by divide and conquer, I know that I for sure learned a lot from him and his styles.

- Looking back some of the challenges I think we had together was just getting used to React, it is are first time messing around with it so starting it we were just getting our bearings, but after a few days we were really able to implement everything we learned from this point from API calls, to iterating over arrays to where some things were we were breezing through. My biggest challenge was learning ```Switch``` statements, and how to use them for different paths

  ### Jacob's Reflection 
  - Rancid tomatillos was a fundamental project I will never forget, implementing react for the first time makes me feel like a real developer using a framework and learning it within a weeks time. This project really was a great time and was well paced enough for me and Richard to really learn the core aspects of react and how it works. From beginning to end Richard was an amazing project partner to work with. He was patient at first when react seemed confusing to me and would always ask great questions and have a unique way of breaking down hard problems.
